## Backend

The backend of the Shipping App is designed to be robust and secure, ensuring that all operations are handled efficiently. Below is an overview of the backend structure:

- `venv`: This directory contains the virtual environment where all the necessary Python packages are installed to keep the development setup consistent.
- `api.py`: The API endpoints are defined here, facilitating the communication between the frontend and the backend.
- `database.py`: This file manages the database connections and operations, ensuring data integrity and providing a layer of abstraction over the database schema.
- `main.py`: The main entry point for the backend server. It initializes the application and brings together all the components.
- `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`: These files are used by Pipenv to manage package dependencies, ensuring that the same package versions are used in every environment.
- `setup.py`: This script is used for packaging and distributing the project, making it easy to install with pip.

The backend is built with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements and integrations. It is also equipped with security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure the privacy of user information.

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the backend, please refer to the `Getting Started` section of this README.

## Getting Started with the Backend

To set up the backend environment, navigate to the backend directory and create a virtual environment:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python main.py
```
